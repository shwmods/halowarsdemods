# Halo Wars: Definitive Edition Operational Rebalance

## Mod Summary

Welcome to my first Halo Wars Mod! Operational Rebalance is designed to meet the following goals:

- Make rushing a less effective tactic.
- Make battles on the PC larger and more epic.
- Enforce the Rock/Paper/Scissors model in a way that de-incentivises single unit spam.
- Give unit upgrades a meaningful place in the sandbox.
- Increase combat variety.
- Make bases less helpless against minor unit spam.
- Encourage an Operational Warfare model over the Tactical Warfare model of Vanilla. For testing and the avoidance of doubt, this means the following things should be successful/happening when playing:

  - Out manouvering of the enemy army to destroy their hardpoints/bases.
  - Counter units defeating units from their counter class unless overwhelmed.
  - Counter units being weak to everything that isn't in their counter class.
  - Uber units (Scarab/Vulture) that are not correctly supported being defeated.
  - Upgraded units outclassing their base versions.
  - Charging a base equipped with turrets results in a significant loss in units - particularly infrantry if present.
  - Armies cannot be so large that they cannot be defeated/attritioned signficantly.
  - Impact of special units and leaders has a smaller game impact than Vanilla.
  - PvP games are more competetive.
  - Rebalance reduces the need of the AI to cheat.
